## üìñ Description
This is a **Jeopardy-style multiplayer competition app** designed for classrooms, clubs, or events. Instructors can create and manage competitions with categories, questions, scores, and special rules like **Daily Doubles**.  

**Markdown Support:** Questions and answers support **Markdown formatting**. For example, adding `#` before words will make them bigger (like headings), and you can use `**bold**`, `_italic_`, code blocks, lists, etc. This makes questions and answers more expressive and visually clear.  

Competing teams can join the game remotely via a shared link (no installation required). The app features a real-time **question board**, **buzzers**, **live score updates**, and team management.
